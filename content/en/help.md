Competence shows how familiar you should be with the technologies mentioned in the article.

- **Elementary**: You know `Getting Started` by heart;
- **Pro**: You use the technology and its toolings;
- **Geek**: You have more answers than questions;

## Who am I?

>I am a Front-end Senpai, who strictly follows the W3Code of Bushido!.

I like to use that phrase. Otherwise, I am **Kosta** and together with my family, I work and live in **Sofia**, **Bulgaria**.
