I had a dog. His name was **Barry Night**. A black standard poodle. About 12 kilograms. He lived exactly 3 years. He passed away on his birthday, during an incident while playing. My beautiful pal is no longer here, but he left me with a legacy that I will share with all of you who have come across this page.

In the morning, when we woke up, Barry would come to us. He wagged his tail, jumped on the bed, brought a toy, and was extremely happy just because he was coming in the morning and we were together. It didn't matter that he had slept with us in bed all night. That he had received attention and cuddles throughout the night. In the morning, it was a new beginning, and he came to show us how to greet the new day.

I couldn't do anything except respond to him with my love and joy. And in a solid amount.

If I were out of his sight, even for 15 minutes, just for a shower, when I came back he would start barking, jumping, twirling, and doing all this until I went to cuddle him and enjoy him.

I couldn't do anything except respond to him with my love and joy. And in a solid amount.
