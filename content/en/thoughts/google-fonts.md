[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) service is very convenient and very easy to use/integrate. There is quite a large selection and a very good way to filter according to your needs. In the Nuxt ecosystem, there is a very good [module to integrate Google Fonts](https://google-fonts.nuxtjs.org/) into your app, but I'm going to show you a slightly different approach - without using a module.
