A long time ago, I stopped maintaining a blog. Currently, I write various articles for repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/howbizarre), but they are not intended for the end users. They are more for people who quickly pass by for information, and I don't put much effort into them because they are targeted towards tech-savvy individuals, for whom I write.

I am starting this blog to share my experience with a wonderful stack of technologies that can achieve anything, well almost anything. You may have noticed the logos I've attached at the top of this site. Those will be the main topics of the blog. It seems to me that the community around these technologies in **Bulgaria** is small, and I hope to contribute to its development over time.

Here are some of the main technologies I will be writing about:

- **Vue** and its ecosystem:
  - **Vue Router** - an essential part of Vue.
  - **Pinia** - I will write more about state management in Vue.
- **Nuxt** and its ecosystem:
  - Nitro - the ready-to-use endpoint for everything...
  - Nuxt Modules - that's the 'community'!
- **Tailwind CSS**
  - Nuxt UI
- **TypeScript**
  - JavaScript
- **Vite** - bundles everything
- **Node** & **Express** & **MongoDB** - secondary technologies that I use and will write about.
- **Firebase** - combined with the above, it works wonders. And it's not as expensive as it seems.

Well, now I just need to find more time. It's good that there is someone to help with generAtIng the texts :o)
